# qpdf-decode: a script for calling qpdf with a password to decrypt a pdf.
# If the operation succeeds, the output will be a default new file adding a
# suffix "_decrypted" to the source file name. Be careful: if the output file
# already existes, it will be overwriten without warning!
#
# Parameters:
# 1. PASSWORD
# 2. file to be decrypted
# 3. (optional) file to save (default: the same name concatenating _decrypted)
